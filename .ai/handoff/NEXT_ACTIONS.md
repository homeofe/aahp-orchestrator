## Ready - Work These Next

### T-011: Dashboard task filtering and sorting *(low priority)*

**Goal:** Add filter controls to the aggregated task view.

**Context:**
- T-005 (aggregated all-repos view) is done - this task is unblocked
- The "All Open Tasks" tree view exists in sidebar but has no filters
- Filter/clear commands already declared in package.json and registered in commands.ts

**What to do:**
1. Add filter dropdown/chips above the all-tasks table: by status, by priority, by repo
2. Use webview message passing to persist filter state
3. Apply filters to the rendered task list
4. Add sort options: by priority (default), by age, by repo name

**Files:**
- `src/sidebar.ts`: add filter controls to all-open-tasks section
- `src/task-tree.ts`: already has `setFilter()` for text filtering - extend with structured filters
- `src/commands.ts`: `aahp.filterTasks` and `aahp.clearFilter` already registered

**Definition of done:**
- [ ] Filter by status works
- [ ] Filter by priority works
- [ ] Filter by repo works
- [ ] Filters persist within session
