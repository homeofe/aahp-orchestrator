## Ready - Work These Next

*(No ready tasks - all development tasks are complete.)*

T-003 (Publish to VS Code Marketplace) is pending human action: the project owner
needs to configure a VSCE_PAT secret. Once that is done, run `npm run publish`
or push a `v*` tag to trigger the release workflow.

## Blocked
