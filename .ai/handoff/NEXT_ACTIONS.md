## Ready - Work These Next

### T-010: Integration tests with VS Code extension host *(low priority)*

**Goal:** Set up real VS Code extension host tests.

**Context:**
- Current tests are pure unit tests with mocked VS Code API (203 tests, 11 suites)
- Integration tests verify the extension actually activates, registers commands, and renders webviews
- Uses `@vscode/test-electron` (officially recommended by VS Code team)

**What to do:**
1. Install `@vscode/test-electron` as dev dependency
2. Create `src/test/suite/` directory with integration test files
3. Create `src/test/suite/index.ts` - Mocha test runner entry
4. Create `src/test/runTest.ts` - launches VS Code with the extension and test suite
5. Test: extension activation, command registration, manifest loading from a fixture `.ai/handoff/` directory
6. Add `test:integration` script to `package.json`

**Files:**
- `src/test/suite/extension.test.ts`: create
- `src/test/suite/index.ts`: test runner entry
- `src/test/runTest.ts`: launch script
- `package.json`: add `test:integration` script

**Definition of done:**
- [ ] At least 5 integration tests
- [ ] Tests pass locally
- [ ] Test script in package.json

### T-011: Dashboard task filtering and sorting *(low priority)*

**Goal:** Add filter controls to the aggregated task view.

**Context:**
- T-005 (aggregated all-repos view) is done - this task is unblocked
- The "All Open Tasks" section exists in sidebar but has no filters

**What to do:**
1. Add filter dropdown/chips above the all-tasks table: by status, by priority, by repo
2. Use webview message passing to persist filter state
3. Apply filters to the rendered task list
4. Add sort options: by priority (default), by age, by repo name

**Files:**
- `src/sidebar.ts`: add filter controls to all-open-tasks section

**Definition of done:**
- [ ] Filter by status works
- [ ] Filter by priority works
- [ ] Filter by repo works
- [ ] Filters persist within session
